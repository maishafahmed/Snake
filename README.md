# Snake
## WHY I MADE THIS GAME
This game is a product of the pandemic boredom in which I wanted to find a way to learn more about machine learning, work on my Lua programming skills whilst making something that i can also play. What I did not imagine it would do is fill my computer with snake coordinates attempting to determine where the food was so idk what this is... ENJOY!
